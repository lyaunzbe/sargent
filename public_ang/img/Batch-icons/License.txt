Batch

A lovingly designed and crafted suite of 300 icons for 
web and user interface design.

Each icon is a single Photoshop shape layer meaning 
they can be scaled up—and down—without loss of quality. 
Adding layer styles and blend modes is also a breeze.

If you use Batch in a Dribbble shot, the inclusion of a 
“Batch” tag would be appreciated so that I can keep a 
curated bucket.

I hope you enjoy Batch. I put a lot of time and effort into their design!

Adam.
